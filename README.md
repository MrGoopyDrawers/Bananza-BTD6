Hey!
I getting started with btd6 modding and doing pretty good so far! I have a bunch of mods here to show you.
Here's a list of mods and there descriptions:

(Download the Bananza.dll file in the project to import it to BTD6)

Adds the Bananza Gamemode in BTD6. Offers DOUBLE cash generation, additional start up cash, and the end round is 200 instead of 100. Pair up with other mods to recreate the fun from BTDB again!
